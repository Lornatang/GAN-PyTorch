If you find a bug, create a GitHub issue, or even better, submit a pull request. Similarly, if you have questions,
simply post them as GitHub issues.

I look forward to seeing what the community does with these models!

**Abstract** <br>
We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train
two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the
probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the
probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary
functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2
everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with
backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either
training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and
quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.
